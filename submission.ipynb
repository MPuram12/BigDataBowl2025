    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "Once the ball is in the air, all bets are off. It becomes a race to see who can get to the ball in time, and who can put themselves in position to make a play. For elite quarterbacks and play callers, recognizing the abilities of these players allows them to plan around or for them, and have a better understanding of the area they cover on the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we propose the metric: Presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric tracks the ability of a player to make a play at any given moment while the ball is in the air, and can be used to define the area coverable by them. \n",

    "We believe it could be incredibly insightful to know which players have a better chance of putting themselves in those positions. \n",

    "## II. Motivation\n",
    "We wanted to narrow in on this idea that a player can be best described by the space they take up because of the shift from a trove of highly physical players such as Calvin Johnson and Julio Jones to a game of speed, with players like Tyreek Hill, Davante Adams, Jamarr Chase, and Justin Jefferson being dominant because of their route running and agility. A player's ability to reach a spot on the field that nobody else could in such a short time can be the difference between an incompletion and a touchdown. That extra step makes a difference, and we wanted to explore how teams can use that knowledge to exploit weaknesses and play to their receivers' strengths. "

    "## III. Defining Presence\n",
    "Different players possess very different skill sets, and the one we want to narrow in on is how much space on the field players can realistically control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a combination of factors, you could put a hundred different players in the same situation where they need to get to the ball. Based on how difficult of a play it is, only some players may be able to reach the ball and be in position to make a play.\n",
    "\n",
    "These players have what we call a greater “presence” on the field. They may be able to cover an additional five yards on any given play, and that is what gives them an edge. They are more likely to be able to make a play on the ball because they are able to make it to the ball.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This report will identify players in various positions who are able to outperform their position group at being in position to make a play. \n"

    "The way we define success is being within a yard and a half of the landing spot of the ball at the end of the play. A frame is considered a \"success frame\" if the final frame is within that yard and a half, and a \"failure frame\" otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, on this play, Trey Walker III got a hand on the ball despite Watson catching it. We would still consider this a successful rep, because Watson had to make a spectacular play to come down with the ball.
